Books.mdb

"Books.mdb" and it's companion database "Books_be.mdb", make up a simple personal book inventory database.  It uses the "BoilerPlate.mdb" sample to create a complete application.

Note:  Put both databases in the same physical directory.  If you do, the front-end (Books.mdb) will always find the tables in the back-end (Books_be.mdb).
